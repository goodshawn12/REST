function general_discontinuity = localized_discontinuity_measure_wrapper(eeg, varargin)
% localized_discontinuity_measure_wrapper is a wrapper for the function
% localized_discontinuity_measure. localized_discontinuity_measure_wrapper
% takes as input an EEGLab data structure and calls 
% localized_discontinuity_measure with the inputs needed by that function.
%
% Input:
% eeg: EEGLab data structure with additional fields virtual_chanlocs and
% virtual_topography. See the readme file for the toolbox for details on
% these fields.
%
% Output:
% general_discontinuity: Column vector containing, for each IC, a measure 
% of discontinuity based on the scalp map.
