function log_range = log_range_spatial(eeg, varargin)
% log_range_spatial calculates the logarithm of the range of values in the
% topographies associated with ICs.
%
% Input:
% eeg: EEGLab data structure with additional field virtual_topography. See 
% the readme file for the toolbox for details on this field.
%
% Output:
% log_range: Vector of length equal to the number of ICs in the input 
% eeg. The vector contains the logarithms of the ranges of values in the
% virtual topography for each IC.
