# Note that "firlsbp200cn" is a paramater file that contains filter settings, in this case
# a 200th-order FIRLS digital filter. If you know what that means, and want to change it, feel

# Currently, SAM is the recommended algorithm for routine analyses; others are in development if

#Also, these jobs will have a qsub priority of -500.
