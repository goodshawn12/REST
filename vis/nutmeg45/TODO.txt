POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT
- check sign of meg/eeg data (it appears to be different between Matlab and CTF)
- CTF read data needs to be permuted (comes out [time,channels,trials], but should be [channels,time,trials])

REWORK OUTPUT:
- save weights and path to original MEG file, rather than whole s_beam
- allow option to use weights with different MEG file

TODO IF YOU'RE BORED:
- use SPM's spm_sections for activation display
- clean up code/unnecessary comments
- make everything batch-process friendly/ call from command line
- use MarsBar for ROI selection? (marsbar.sourceforge.net)
- average time series around cursor
- for CTF, allow selection (random?) of channel subset for quick analysis ???
- somehow allow montage selection
- estimate time of completion for long procedures...

- ability to combine multiple runs?

- incorporate uigetpref & uisetpref

- MOVIE generation
    - mac/windows-compatible version
    - allow specification of time interval

FUTURE:
- connectivity analyses
- sensor time-frequency analyses
- parallel MATLAB
- direct render on MNI brain
- anon svn
